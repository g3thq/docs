## Welcome to the Ghost Project
Ghost (g3t) is a early stage vuln research project and security toolkit in the areas of container image assurance and IaC.
It is our mission to provide an open community approach to vuln findings in these areas.

Currently g3t offers a container vulnerability scanner. Check out the [downloads](/docs/downloads) page.

#### Resources

To accomplish our mission, we offer a set of minimal-config cloud primitives:

1. **[Deta Base](#deta-base)** (beta): Instantly usable database with a feature-rich API.
2. **[Deta Micros](#deta-micros)** (beta): Deploy scalable Node & Python apps in seconds.
3. **Deta Drive** (soon): Upload, host and serve images and files.
4. **Deta Auth** (soon): Effortless signup, login & accounts for your apps.


#### Local Development and the Deta CLI

Most developers like their local development flow. We provide a CLI that ties your local development workflow to your micro cloud, see:

- [Deta CLI](#deta-cli)


#### Support

If you have any questions, we provide a few ways to get help ASAP:

### Deta Base

Deta Base is our instantly usable NoSQL database.

- [About Deta Base](base/about.md): General Information about Bases.
- [Base SDK](base/sdk.md): SDK for using a Base in Node.js and Python.
- [HTTP API](base/HTTP.md): API for interacting with a Base over HTTP.
- [Node.js Tutorial](base/node_tutorial.md): Build a micro-crud in Node.js using Base and Express.js.
- [Python Tutorial](base/py_tutorial.md): Build a micro-crud in Python using Base and Flask.


### Deta Micros

Deta Micros(servers) are a lightweight but scalable cloud runtime tied to an HTTP endpoint. Currently Node.js and Python Micros are supported.

- [About Deta Micros](micros/about.md): General Information about Micros.
- [Getting Started with Micros](micros/getting_started.md): Get your first Micro live.


### Deta CLI

The Deta CLI allows you to tie your local machine and dev setup to your own personal micro cloud.

You create and update micros using the CLI.

- [Install the Deta CLI](cli/install.md)
- [Complete CLI Reference](cli/commands.md)
